# Project 7 - *Taske*

Submitted by: **Yadisa Belliard**

**Task** is an app that ... 
In this project, I updated an existing Task app with the ability to save and persist task data to local storage using UserDefaults. In addition I added tab bar navigation so users can manage their tasks on the main tasks list as well as a calendar.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a list of tasks
- [X] Users can add tasks to the list
- [X] Session persists when application is closed and relaunched (tasks dont get deleted when closing app) 
- [X] Note: You have to quit the app, not minimize it, in order to see the persistence.
- [X] Tasks can be deleted
- [X] Users have a calendar view via navigation controller that displays tasks	


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Tasks can be toggled completed
- [X] User can edit tasks by tapping on the task in the feed view
- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
